# jontext

This MCP server provides maximum Jon context to whatever models need it.

## Install

The `example_config.json` can be used to update your Claude Desktop (for
example) with the configuration required to start the server.

You'll also need to add a file to this folder called `mli_client_token.txt` with
the correct API token for Monolithium.

Then if the gems aren't installed you can `bundle install` to get things going.
